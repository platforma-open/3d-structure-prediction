Clarify NanoBodyBuilder2 usage in the settings panel: relabel the light chain dropdown as optional with a tooltip, and expand the mode-info alert to note that NanoBodyBuilder2 is camelid-VHH-trained, so for conventional heavy-only inputs (e.g. human bulk IGH-only) the produced structure has VHH-biased framework geometry.

Drop the user-facing CPU and memory inputs (per-batch resources are fixed). Each prediction batch now requests 4 CPU cores and 4 GiB of memory.

Stop writing a wall-clock `prediction-date` REMARK into emitted PDBs. The timestamp made every PDB byte-different on every run, breaking the platforma backend's content-addressed caching — downstream nodes that consumed merged PDB ResourceMaps hit `CIDConflictError`. The other provenance REMARKs (immunebuilder version, torch seed, block version, numbering scheme) plus the seeded ensemble fully determine the prediction.

Make the saved Python wrapper log byte-stable for identical inputs: drop the per-line UTC timestamp prefix and remove every wall-clock duration printed by `_log` (`predictor ready in Xs`, `predicted in Xs`, `elapsed=Xs`). The exec template saves stdout via `saveStdoutStream()` into the regular file output set, so its content hash flows into the resource CID; timestamped logs would re-introduce the same `CIDConflictError` failure mode as the PDB date.

Set `stepCache: 30 * times.minute` on the `processColumn` call so per-batch outputs stay reachable for the dedup/recovery path across project re-renders, matching the convention used by mixcr-clonotyping and miltenyi-tcr-bcr-clonotyping.
